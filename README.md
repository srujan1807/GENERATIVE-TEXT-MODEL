*Descrpition*:
This project implements a Generative Text Model using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The model is capable of generating human-like text based on an input prompt. It uses deep learning methods‚Äîsuch as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), or Transformer-based architectures‚Äîto learn patterns in language and produce coherent, contextually relevant text.

üîç Features
Generate creative and context-aware text

Train on custom datasets

Configurable model architecture and training parameters

Supports inference from user-provided prompts

Can be fine-tuned for specific domains or writing styles

üöÄ Use Cases
Chatbots and virtual assistants

Story or poetry generation

Content suggestions and completions

Educational and creative writing tools
